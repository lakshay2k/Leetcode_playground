# Dynamic Programming Problems

***I will be solving problems based on dynamic programming using C++***

***1. Climbing stairs - In this we find number of ways to climb "n" stairs with capablity of jumping 1 and 2 stairs atmost.***

***2. Best time to sell and buy stocks - Using dynamic thinking i calculated the maximum profit of all combinations when to buy and when to sell***

***3. Largest sum SubArray using KADANE's Algorithm in C++***

***4. House Robbers : Dynamic approach using arrays and vectors***

***5. Jump Game : Dynamic approach implemented in C++***

***6. Unique Paths : Dynamic Approach using C++***

***7. Coin Change : Dynamic Approach using C++***

***8. Longest Increasing Subsequence : Dynamic approach in C++***
